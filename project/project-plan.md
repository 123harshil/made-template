# Project Plan

## Title
Traffic Prediction based on Weather.

## Main Question

How does weather affects the traffic on our daily schedule.

## Description

Traffic is an important problem in our daily life due to some various factor for e.g. saftey purpose. This project analyze the number of vehichles during the particular day and time to detect the traffic conditions on the different day and time and we have the weather data which gives the insight about the weather conditions on the different days and at different time. From the following dataset we can give the insight about the traffic condition at particular locationa and time based on the weather condition.

## Datasources



### Datasource1: 
* Traffic Prediction Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibullahaman/traffic-prediction-dataset?select=Traffic.csv
* Data Type: CSV
### Datasource2:
* Weather Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muthuj7/weather-dataset?select=weatherHistory.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The both the dataset are from the kaggle and are public.

## Work Packages
1. We will go through the whole dataset and understand the dataset and plan for the project which insight are more important for our prediction.
2. Then we will check the missing values or the misspell words in the dataset. If there is any we have to correct it.
3. Then we will check the some correlation between the columns.
4. Then we analyze the data and give some insight with the help of the visualization.
